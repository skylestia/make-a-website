# So you want to make a website...

... but you don't have any money to spend on it right now. Well, did you know that there are actually numerous ways to get a free website right now (2023)?

## Introduction

Personally, I grew up in the 2000s: I remember Myspace although I wasn't really on it, and I saw Facebook take over the social media scene, although I didn't really follow the news about it. All my friends were on Facebook and other social media or chatrooms, and being a child of the era myself you might think I would have been too, but I wasn't. I mean I had an account on Facebook technically, but I was raised in a pretty strict home, and I wasn't allowed to use the computer except for small allotments at a time, and I wasn't allowed to use Facebook or social sites in general without supervision. There was a time when I thought computers were only for adults...

and it might sound like I'm complaining, and I kind of am. Because of the way I was raised, it was pretty difficult for me to connect with my peers. I didn't understand cultural references or jokes, didn't know what a meme was, didn't know about any popular trends, didn't really have any friends, and in general didn't really have any private or alone time or space of my own. It very likely contributed to some of the mental health issues I now struggle with- especially agoraphobia.

*But I'm also kind of happy about it.*

I'm happy I got to be a kid who was *not online.* Nowadays, in my 20s, I struggle to get **away** from the internet. I remember how much I used to read and write, *all the time...* every moment I could steal away for myself, I was writing something or reading something. I would check out 6 or 7 books at a time from my library, I'd beg my mom to buy me notebooks and pens, and I'd build *worlds* for myself. Twelve-year-old Skye wouldn't get stuck in a decade long procrastination cycle and never finish her novel; she'd get it done in a couple of months max! I miss that time of my life. I miss being able to sit down and *just write* for hours. And I largely blame the internet for destroying my attention span and giving me so many more options for things to do. I *could* write a new chapter in Where Things End, *but* I wonder what my mutuals are up to. I *could* write a new chapter in Sands of the New World, *but* I also need to check on my ranch in Minecraft. I *could* write a new chapter in Edge of the Crescent, but I'll just take a minute first to watch some videos on my fyp...

I have recently stumbled across a couple of movements online that quickly stole up all of my interest; one [a movement of nostalgia for the old web, the 90s and early 00s web: the GeoCities web.](https://oneterabyteofkilobyteage.tumblr.com/) People who experience this sense of nostalgia are often involved in or follow efforts to document and archive, access and preserve, ancient websites that were once hosted on GeoCities (and sometimes other old website hosts). The other, [a movement that dislikes, or is at least dissatisfied with, the modern web](https://yesterweb.org/) and wants to see personal websites make a comeback in the modern culture. These movements often overlap and the people who participate often want to make creating, maintaining, and having a personal website more mainstream - to make having a personal site, even, competitive with modern social media. [Heck, some people even want to completely replace social media with personal websites.](https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbanny/we-should-replace-facebook-with-personal-websites)

Speaking as someone who grew up in the 00s: it seemed normal back then to be online. There was almost a shimmering air of positivity about the internet, at least from people in my generation. It's like it was almost thought of as the future of life, something that would become fundamental and essential to our everyday lives. And, as much as the internet has become very important to our culture and, perhaps, to political discussion and discourse, news and dissemination of information; it has equally become, for many people, a stressful and annoying place to be. Certain social media platforms are often blamed for spiking people's anxiety or depression or other mental health issues, they're often blamed for much worse acts that people commit. It creates in-groups and out-groups, it others and it excludes...

It was almost expected in my school that everyone had at least one account on at least one social media platform, and everyone had a cell phone. People just a few years older than me may have even had personal websites back when that was the mainstream thing to do online, back when GeoCities was the dominant platform of personal online spaces. Speaking as someone who lived in a strict home and didn't really have any real access to the internet until she was almost an adult: when I finally did have my own computer and could go online whenever I wanted to, *I didn't really have an urge to be active on social media.* Well, that's not really true. I wanted to be active on social media, I created accounts on several platforms and even used Facebook for a few years as a teenager and young adult, but the more I used it, the less interested I became in it. Until eventually, I wasn't really posting often or actively on anything almost at all. But I *did* always have an interest in having my own website.

I didn't really know what I wanted my website to be about, didn't know what people would do once on my website, or really anything about making or designing websites, but I still managed to learn html and css and found ways to put up my own website. It was a personal website where I talked about myself, stuff I was interested in, and posted things I made and stuff like that. I suppose it was, realistically, a way that I was social online. *It was my own personal alternative to Facebook, Twitter, and the rest.* It was where I could be myself and do whatever I wanted. It was also a playground, where I learned a lot about web development and design, teaching myself html, css, php, and javascript. Was it popular? Almost certainly not! I never put a visitor counter on that website, but I'd guess it wasn't very frequently trafficked by anyone other than myself and bots. I'm just simply not a very interesting person, so most people would really have no reason to stay on my site. But it was fun! It was new! It was creative and inspiring to me! *It was a better and more positive experience for me overall than any major social media platform has ever been before or since.*

Some time in 2018 or so my host went down. *I lost my entire site.* Feeling discouraged, I wasn't sure that I was still interested in web development anymore, I wasn't sure if I still had it in me to want to build a new site *from scratch.* I wasn't sure if I could replace the site that I had lost. So I didn't. Instead, I found an alternative host, Github Pages, and I decided to just write a simple page for linking my social media. And that was my website ever since... until recently.

Because recently I discovered [Neocities](https://neocities.org/), and I discovered those movements which are nostalgic for the old web... and I felt *inspired* again... I felt *drawn in.* And I started working on a new site. But as I worked on it, I decided that I wanted to incorporate my Tumblr onto the site somehow. I wanted people visiting my site to be able to click on a link in the navbar to like a "blog" or a "Tumblr" and open up to my [skylestia.tumblr.com page,](https://skylestia.tumblr.com/) but also still have access to the navigation and header of my site. I thought about embedding it with an 0but I don't really like iframes as a solution for solving situations like this one, so instead I wrote a custom Tumblr theme that would make it look like my website and link back to it. But then I wanted to be able to serve common assets on both my site and my Tumblr, so I started looking into even more alternative hosting providers that could host those common assets since Neocities doesn't allow [hotlinking.](https://https://neocities.org/site_files/hotlinking) While I was trying out different hosts, I noticed a fair amount of other people in comments on Youtube videos, in reviews of services, and on subreddits who were looking for good free website hosts and so I thought it might be fun to write an article about this experience and to maybe guide people who want to make their own websites on how to do it, to show them how to do what I have done.

So:

## Just exactly how many free hosting options are there?

I'm going to list them here, starting with some of the most popular options.

## What I see recommended the most:

[**Github Pages**](https://pages.github.com/)

For free you get:

- 1 GB file size upload limit
- 1 GB storage space
- 100 GB bandwidth per month

Full limits: [About GitHub Pages - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#usage-limits)

Github Pages is completely free forever. You can use it to host static websites with html, css, and javascript. You can write your own code, or you can use a [template.](https://pages.github.com/themes/) It works by serving files contained in a regular Github repository publicly on the web. Your site will be available on a .github.io subdomain. You can use custom domains with Github Pages, but you need to obtain the domain from a domain name provider, which is almost never free.

[**Gitlab Pages**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/)

For free you get:

- 5 GB storage space
- 10 GB transfer per month
- 400 compute minutes per month
- 5 users per name space

Full limits: [Pricing | GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/)

Gitlab Pages is completely free forever. It works just like Github Pages: it supports static sites in html, css, and javascript and serves files contained in Gitlab repos. You can write your own code or use a [template.](https://gitlab.com/pages) Sites are available on a .gitlab.io subdomain. You can use custom domains.

[**Codeberg Pages**](https://codeberg.page/)

Codeberg Pages is completely free forever. It works just like the other two git services above: it supports static sites in html, css, and javascript and serves files contained in Codeberg repos. You can write your own code or use a template. Sites are available on a .codeberg.page subdomain. You can use custom domains.

As far as I know, as far as I can find, Codeberg has **no** bandwidth or storage limits. But I wouldn't recommend them if you have a very high-traffic site because Codeberg is a completely free and open-source platform that only makes money from user donations, and I don't know what their servers can handle. Basically, just don't be selfish.

[**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/)

For free you get:

- 1 concurrent build
- 100 GB bandwidth per month
- unlimited storage space (but larger sites lose performance)

Full limits: [Netlify Pricing and Plans](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/)

Netlify is free forever, but it does charge you if you go over the limits of your chosen monthly plan. In this case for example, on the free plan if you go over 100 GB bandwidth in a month, they charge you for the data that goes over it.

...

**Of these four services,** I have only personally used Github Pages. I have never had any problems with Github Pages and I used it for about 4 years in a row uninterrupted. I see Netlify recommended to people on Reddit a lot, but I would not consider using it if you're in a situation where you absolutely can't afford to pay for anything. It's really unlikely that you could go over their 100 GB bandwidth per month limit, or any of their other limits, but why risk it?

***Luckily, there are still many more options for free hosting providers.***

## Other services I see recommended:

[**Neocities**](https://neocities.org/)

For free you get:

- 1 GB storage space
- 200 GB bandwidth per month

Neocities is completely free forever, or as long as the service runs. You can edit your site directly in their online code editor or you can upload files from your computer. Neocities also offers a [free course]([Neocities - HTML Tutorial - 1/10](https://neocities.org/tutorial/html/1)) on how to code basic html and css. Basic html and css is very easy to learn, so don't feel intimidated!
