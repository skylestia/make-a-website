## HTML Templates

An HTML template is a pre-written html document, and often an accompanying css stylesheet, that anyone can use for their own project.

- EGGRAMEN is the personal website of someone called Eggy, and they made a bunch of free-to-use templates here.

#### [Ground Floor](https://groundfloor.neocities.org/)
- Ground Floor aims to provide basic styles for all html elements, "so that even if you never add a single class, or touch a line of CSS your HTML won't look like a jumble of browser presets, or bland looking text."

## Drag-and-Drop Web Editors

A drag-and-drop web editor is a tool that lets users create websites by dragging and dropping elements with their mouse, usually without needing to know any code or having to ever interact with or see any code. A lot of drag-and-drop web editors also host user-created websites.

#### [Carrd](https://carrd.co/)
- Carrd is a free web builder that has become a very popular place for people to share things like a short bio, pronouns, interests, and other personal details. If you pay for the premium version you can also write your own code.
