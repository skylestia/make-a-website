## Very popular:

#### [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

For free you get:

- 1 GB file size upload limit
- 1 GB storage space
- 100 GB bandwidth per month
- no charges, no fees

Full limits: [About GitHub Pages - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#usage-limits)

Github Pages is completely free forever. You can use it to host static websites with html, css, and javascript. You can write your own code, or you can use a [template.](https://pages.github.com/themes/) It works by serving files contained in a regular Github repository publicly on the web. Your site will be available on a .github.io subdomain. You can use custom domains with Github Pages, but you need to obtain the domain from a domain name provider, which is almost never free.

#### [Gitlab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/)

For free you get:

- 5 GB storage space
- 10 GB transfer per month
- 400 compute minutes per month
- 5 users per name space
- no charges, no fees

Full limits: [Pricing - GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/)

Gitlab Pages is completely free forever. It works just like Github Pages: it supports static sites in html, css, and javascript and serves files contained in Gitlab repos. You can write your own code or use a [template.](https://gitlab.com/pages) Sites are available on a .gitlab.io subdomain. You can use custom domains.

#### [Codeberg Pages](https://codeberg.page/)

For free you get:

- unlimited storage ?
- unlimited bandwidth ?
- no charges, no fees

Codeberg Pages is completely free forever. It works just like the other two git services above: it supports static sites in html, css, and javascript and serves files contained in Codeberg repos. You can write your own code or use a template. Sites are available on a .codeberg.page subdomain. You can use custom domains.

As far as I know, as far as I can find, Codeberg has **no** bandwidth or storage limits. But I wouldn't recommend them if you have a very high-traffic site because Codeberg is a completely free and open-source platform that only makes money from user donations, and I don't know what their servers can handle. Basically, just don't be selfish.

#### [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

For free you get:

- 1 concurrent build
- 100 GB bandwidth per month
- unlimited storage space (but larger sites lose performance)
- pay as you go, charged if you exceed free limits

Full limits: [Netlify Pricing and Plans](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/)

## Somewhat less popular:

#### [Neocities](https://neocities.org/)

For free you get:

- 1 GB storage space
- 200 GB bandwidth per month
- no charges, no fees

Full limits: [Neocities - Become a Supporter](https://neocities.org/supporter)

Neocities is open source and completely free forever, or as long as the service runs. Sites hosted by Neocities are available on a .neocities.org subdomain. You can use a custom domain, but only if you pay for a premium account. You can edit your site directly in their online code editor or you can upload files from your computer. Neocities also offers a [free course]([Neocities - HTML Tutorial - 1/10](https://neocities.org/tutorial/html/1)) on how to code basic html and css. Basic html and css is very easy to learn, so don't feel intimidated!

#### [Surge](https://surge.sh/)

For free you get:

- unlimited bandwidth
- basic SSL
- no charges, no fees

Full limits: [Pricing • Surge](https://surge.sh/pricing)

Surge is free to use forever, however free accounts are heavily limited compared to paid accounts. Still, unlimited bandwidth for free is really great! Surge runs on your local machine and publishes whatever folder you run it in to the web. Free sites hosted by surge are available on a .surge.sh subdomain. You can use a custom domain with Surge, but they don't register domains so you'll have to obtain your custom domain from a dedicated domain name provider.

## Others:

#### [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)

For free you get:

- 1 build at a time
- 500 builds per month
- unlimited bandwidth
- no charges, no fees

Full limits: [Cloudflare Pages Pricing](https://pages.cloudflare.com/#pricing)

With Cloudflare Pages you can either edit your sites code locally on your computer with your preferred editor and then upload the files to Cloudflare, or connect your Cloudflare account with your Github account and deploy to Cloudflare from a Github repository. Free sites are available on a .pages.dev subdomain. You can use a custom domain, but you have to pay for them.

#### [render](https://render.com/)

For free you get:

- 400 build hours per month
- 100 GB bandwidth per month
- pay as you go, charged if you exceed free limits

render works similarly to Cloudflare Pages: you can connect to Github or Gitlab and deploy your site from a repository. Free sites are available on a .onrender.com subdomain. You can use custom domains with render, but you'll have to obtain one from a dedicated domain name provider.

#### [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)

For free you get:

- 15 GB storage
- 15 GB bandwidth per month
- pay as you go, charged if you exceed free limits

Full limits: [AWS Product and Service Pricing - Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/?nc2=h_ql_pr_ln&aws-products-pricing.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-pricing.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Type=free-tier%23always-free&awsf.tech-category=*all)

#### [ichi city](https://ichi.city/)

For free you get:

- unlimited storage ?
- unlimited bandwidth ?
- no charges, no fees

ichi city is open source and completely free forever. I have no idea what the hosting limits are. ichi city seems to be a personal project of [m15o](https://m15o.ichi.city/) and I'm not really sure how the project is funded, so I imagine it would be ideal to not upload very large sites or high traffic sites here. ichi is also explicitly not for advertising, so if your website is just self-promotion you shouldn't use ichi city.

#### [tilde town](http://tilde.town/)

For free you get:

- unlimited storage ?
- unlimited bandwidth ?
- no charges, no fees

tilde town is also open source and completely free forever. I don't know what the hosting limits are, and tilde appears to be funded entirely by user donations.
