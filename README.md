## Introduction

I want it to be as easy as possible for people to learn html and css and making and hosting their own personal websites. This repository will contain basic html and css templates that people can use as starting points for their websites, as well as both tutorials on how to code basic html and css and guides on how to find a host and domain name.

You don't need any prior experience in coding html or css to be able to follow the guides here! You actually don't need any prior experience in any coding at all, so please don't feel intimidated! Html and css are very easy to learn, especially html, and if you'd rather not bother learning css yet, it is optional! You don't need to know css to code in html, and while css does complement html and allows you to style the html you write, your html can exist on its own without any css. If you've ever used a forum and used BBCode to format posts, you will probably have a very easy time picking up html.

Here's a very basic example of how to write a paragraph in html:

`<p>`Anything enclosed inside of `<p>` and `</p>` will be rendered as a "paragraph" element. Typically you use these elements to write most text on a web page. **`<b>`The tags `<b>` and `</b>` will make text bold.`</b>`** *`<i>`The tags `<i>` and `</i>` will make text italic.`</i>`* <ins>`<u>`The tags `<u>` and `</u>` will underline text.`</u>`</ins> `</p>`

That is just an extremely basic example, but you can see that html is very easy to write and very easy to learn. If your goal is to make a simple, static, personal website where you can talk about yourself and your interests or passions, or write a blog or post art or anything like that, then the above example has already taught you most of what you need to know in terms of code! You're already well on your way to having a website!

## Mission Statement

It's 2023, the internet has been around for something like 40 years. But the modern web consists of mostly just a few websites, just a few enormous platforms that everyone visits day to day. Many uses only ever visit Google, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Reddit, and a few other sites and apps. There's not much room for users to be creative with their personal spaces on these platforms, they get little more than the ability to upload custom profile pictures and write short custom bios. *Everything looks the same, everything uses the same underlying technologies... there is often little to set any one page apart from any other.* But it wasn't always this way.

In the '90s and early '00s, the internet was a far more personal, diverse, and interesting place. Back then, a huge portion of the internet were individuals' personal websites hosted on places like GeoCities and Angelfire. These people were usually not professional web developers, but because html is so easy to learn and because services like GeoCities offered free hosting space to anyone who wanted it, creating personal websites was extremely accessible for huge amounts of people. *Like, at the peak of GeoCities' existence, it hosted more than 38 million pages!*

GeoCities is often considered the first social network, although it was nothing like modern social media platforms. People poured love into their personal sites and learned and practiced skills to make and keep them updated. People posted personal pictures, family memories, inner thoughts, secret dreams, and virtually anything else you can imagine. *These were passion projects for many people, and they were important to many more people.* Could any of those personal websites compare to the popularity of mainstream social media in the modern day? Probably not. But being popular wasn't necessarily the point of the personal websites back then. It was just fun. It was new. It was creative and inspiring! Ask your parents. If they were online in 1999, they probably had a GeoCities or knew someone who did. With a gleam in their eye, they'll probably love to show you their old site: to see it again, and share its contents with someone new once more.

Nowadays people use social media and the internet in general to consume more than to create. These platforms are often stages for a few popular people or corporations to post content that the rest of the internet's population consumes. The overwhelming majority of users post and interact somewhat infrequently in comparison. But perhaps more concerning is that the atmospheres of these platforms are often seen as very negative or downright toxic. Sites like Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, and TikTok are often cited directly as negatively effecting peoples' anxiety, causing them serious emotional or mental distress, *and sometimes even worse.*

Which culture would **you** prefer? It may be the case that the peak of social media, its best form, the form that had the most positive effect it could have on users and the world in general, was before the rise of the current mainstream social platforms. *I believe the best form of social activity online might have been before the rise of current social platforms that treat users as a product and fundamentally enforce an atmosphere of competition via algorithms.* Modern social media dehumanizes and commodifies users, it divides and excludes. But the web of the past was one where the people were put first, because it was made by the people.

I want to see the personal web rise again, I want to see people creating and maintaing personal websites in their free time for fun. I want personal websites to exist alongside regular social media, and I want anyone who wants to have a website, to have a website. I want to help make the process of making a website more accessible, and I want to help make it seem less daunting or overwhelming to beginners.
