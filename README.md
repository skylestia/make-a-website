## Introduction

I want it to be as easy as possible for people to learn html and css and make and host their own personal websites. This repository will contain basic html and css templates that people can use as starting points for their websites, as well as both tutorials on how to code basic html and css. It will also include a list of free web hosts and a list of site generators and builders.

You don't need any prior experience in coding html or css to be able to follow the guides here! You actually don't need any prior experience in any coding at all, so please don't feel intimidated! Html and css are very easy to learn, especially html, and if you'd rather not bother learning css yet, it is optional! You don't need to know css to code in html, and while css does complement html and allows you to style the html you write, your html can exist on its own without any css. If you've ever used a forum and used BBCode to format posts, you will probably have a very easy time picking up html.

Here's a very basic example of how to write a paragraph in html:

`<p>`Anything enclosed inside of `<p>` and `</p>` will be interpreted as a "paragraph" element. Typically you use these elements to write most text on a web page. **`<b>`The tags `<b>` and `</b>` will make text bold.`</b>`** *`<i>`The tags `<i>` and `</i>` will make text italic.`</i>`* <ins>`<u>`The tags `<u>` and `</u>` will underline text.`</u>`</ins> `</p>`

That is just an extremely basic example, but you can see that html is very easy to write and very easy to learn. If your goal is to make a simple, static, personal website where you can talk about yourself and your interests or passions, or write a blog or post art or anything like that, then the above example has already taught you most of what you need to know in terms of code! You're already well on your way to having a website!
